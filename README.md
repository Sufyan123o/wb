   - Replace `CAPSOLVER_API_KEY = "REPLACE"` with your actual API key:
     ```python
     CAPSOLVER_API_KEY = "CAP-YOUR-ACTUAL-API-KEY-HERE"
     ```

### Setup Your Profiles

Edit the `profiles.csv` file with your application details. Each row represents one ballot entry:

MAKE THE INFORMATION UNIQUE. WIMBOLEDON MAY REJECT DUPLICATE ENTRIES.
Use uniqeue emails, phone numbers, and addresses. USE A REAL NAME AS THEY CHECK ID AT THE ENTRANCE.
```csv
Email,Name,AddressLine1,City,Postcode,MobileNumber,password,dob_day,dob_month,dob_year
john.doe@email.com,John Doe,123 Main Street,London,SW1A 1AA,07123456789,SecurePass123!,15,March,1990
jane.smith@email.com,Jane Smith,456 Park Avenue,Manchester,M1 1AA,07987654321,AnotherPass456!,22,July,1985
```

## üéÆ Running the Bot

Simply run the script:

```bash
python wb.py
```

### What Happens:

1. **Profile Loading**: Loads all profiles from `profiles.csv`
2. **Sequential Processing**: Processes each profile one by one
3. **Automated Steps** for each profile:
   - Opens stealth Chrome browser
   - Navigates to Wimbledon ballot page
   - Solves initial CAPTCHA automatically
   - Handles cookie consent
   - Clicks "JOIN THE BALLOT" button
   - Fills all form fields with profile data
   - Solves any additional CAPTCHAs
   - Submits the application
4. **Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time status updates
5. **Final Summary**: Displays success/failure statistics

### Example Output:

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### CAPTCHA Settings
- The bot uses CapSolver API for automatic CAPTCHA solving
- Set `AUTO_SOLVE_CAPTCHA = True` to enable automatic solving
- Set `AUTO_SOLVE_CAPTCHA = False` for manual CAPTCHA handling

### Rate Limiting
- Default 30-second delay between profiles
- Modify the delay in the main function if needed:
  ```python
  time.sleep(30)  # Change this value
  ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**‚ùå "CSV file not found"**
- Ensure `profiles.csv` is in the same directory as `wb.py`
- Check file permissions

**‚ùå "CAPTCHA solving failed"**
- Verify your CapSolver API key is correct
- Check your CapSolver account balance
- Ensure stable internet connection

**‚ùå "Failed to find/click JOIN button"**
- The website layout may have changed
- Check if the ballot is currently open
- Verify the ballot URL is accessible

**‚ùå Chrome driver issues**
- The script auto-installs Chrome driver
- Ensure Chrome browser is installed and updated
- Check internet connection for driver download

### Debug Mode:
For detailed debugging, modify the logging level in `wb.py`:
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
```
